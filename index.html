                        <p>Danielle has always had a passion for crafting. Even    as  a young child, she has preferred to keep her hands     busy creating art. 
                            The concept of a kid's crafting club came after years of facilitating craft projects as a volunteer in her childrens' 
                            classrooms and as an educator in the local public schools.  
                            Danielle knows the importance of the impact art has on developing students.  
                            In an effort to help teachers, Danielle offers in-person crafting experiences for classrooms.
